# zshrc themes

Three versions of `.zshrc` light and self-contained theme that do not need heavy stuff like *ohmyzsh*, with the basic stuff for a fresh install. *Auto Completion, Syntax Highlighting, Autosuggestions* plugins are sourced but require installation, so either install them or remove the line if not needed.

## zshrc.basic: 
Colorful with different prompts for the current user and the root user

## zshrc.git.full:
More elaborate version that displays the git branch and status
