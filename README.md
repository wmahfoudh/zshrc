# zshrc minimal theme

A minimal .zshrc theme I created to avoid heavy plugins. Aside from the stock zsh plugins, it is self contained offering:

1. Basic options for a fresh install
2. Custom prompt for current user and different prompt for root user
3. Auto completion, syntax highlighting, autosuggestions sourced and set (need to install the plugins)
4. Key bindings

Fully commented for easy customization, it needs the Meslo font to display the icons properly:

As it is not easy to find the "right" icon, I added some as comments at the end of the file, so you can just copy and replace/add in your own custom prompt.
