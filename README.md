# zshrc themes

Three versions of `.zshrc` light and self-contained theme that do not need heavy stuff like ohmyzsh. They have the basic stuff for a fresh install:

## zshrc.basic: 
Colorful with different prompts for the current user and the root user

## zshrc.git.full:
More elaborate version that displays the git branch and status
